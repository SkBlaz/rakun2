Britain fought alongside France, Russia and (after 1917) the United States, against Germany and its allies in the First World War (1914â€“1918).[119] British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western front.[120] The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order.
